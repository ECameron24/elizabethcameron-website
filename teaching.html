	<h2>Teaching</h2>
	<p>In December 2016, I graduated from Eastern Kentucky University with a Bachelor of Science 	in Elementary Education, K-5.</p>
	<p>Currently, I teach fifth grade math at Mt. Vernon Elementary School in Mt. Vernon, 		Kentucky. I have previously taught first, second, and third grades, all being self-contained 	classrooms. The 2024-2025 school year will mark my eighth year of teaching.</p>
